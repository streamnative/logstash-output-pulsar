## Sync vs Async

Sync is slower because it requires verification that a message is received. Sync supports exactly/effectively once messaging. This means there is a big network latency increase here.

Async is faster because it sends messages out and doesn't care if the message was received/processed or not. Async should only be used if you want "at most once" messaging and don't care if messages are lost.

# Example
pulsar without tls & token 
```
output{
  pulsar{
    serviceUrl => "pulsar://127.0.0.1:6650"
    topic => "persistent://public/default/%{topic_name}"
    producer_name => "%{producer_name}"
    enable_batching => true
  }
}
```
pulsar with token
```
output {
  pulsar{
    serviceUrl => "pulsar://localhost:6650"
    topic => "persistent://public/default/%{topic_name}"
    producer_name => "%{producer_name}"
    enable_batching => true
    enable_token => true
    auth_plugin_class_name => "org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationToken"
    auth_plugin_params_String => "token:%{token}"
  }
}
```
